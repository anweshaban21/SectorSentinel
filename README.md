# üìä Sectoral Stock Analysis Across Bullish and Bearish Market Phases

This project analyzes the behavior of different Indian stock market sectors during **bullish** and **bearish** phases using time series forecasting and risk assessment models. It identifies which model combinations perform best in different market regimes and across various sectors.

---

## üìå Objective

To compare the performance of multiple models (GARCH, LSTM, Beta) in predicting returns and assessing risk across sectors under different market conditions (bullish and bearish periods), and to determine the most suitable model combination per sector and regime.

## üîß Methodology

1. **Data Collection** using `yfinance`
2. **Market Regime Detection** (manual selection based on NIFTY trends)
3. **Model Implementation**:
   - GARCH
   - LSTM
   - Beta (CAPM-style risk model)
   - Hybrid combinations:
     - GARCH + Beta
     - LSTM + Beta
     - GARCH + LSTM
     - GARCH + LSTM + Beta
4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Sharpe Ratio
   - Custom Risk Score
5. **Sector-wise Comparison** across regimes

---

## ‚úÖ Key Results

- **LSTM + Beta**: Best performing model in **bullish** periods for **IT** and **Banking** sectors.
- **GARCH + Beta**: Most effective in **bearish** periods for **Pharma** and **FMCG** sectors.
- Model behavior varies significantly by both **sector** and **market regime**.
